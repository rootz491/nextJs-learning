#	NextJs

i'm learning nextJs now. It's react framework, loved by 10xDevelopes and very fast to create production friendly applications.

*	Untill now, i read some documentation and feeling good about this decision of learning *nextJs*.

*	Tried **sanity (CMS)** with NextJs by direcly using their template project and modifying it.

*	Tried using API stuff of nextJs which is pretty neat untill you get stuck with `mongoose` to use MongoDB database in your project.

	*	Since then, i'm trying to find a reliable backend & database to work with, using with I can do CRUD and other simple operations required in building web application. 

#### firebase with nextJs

>	Just remembered about firebase after months, and now thinking about using it in next project.
	It can give realtime database which is perfect for react apps and way to write backend thru functions which can get tricky because it requires `credit card` to use firebase fuctions.

	So let's see!

[Here](https://github.com/fireship-io/next-firebase-course)'s the source code of [this](https://next-firebase-course-git-main-fireship.vercel.app/) web app by fireship from his pro-membership course where he used firebase and nextJs together.

####	mongoose with nextJs

Above issue is resolved now, means CRUD is pretty straight forward using `mongoose` thru *API* for *client-side* availability or even *server-side rendering* thru directly calling corresponding *CRUD* function inside `getServerSideProps` function.
